# Car-Wala
>## Motivation
>The main aim of our project is to provide user friendly website that can be used to deploy our machine learning model .

>As we are progressing to a new age of revolution , there has been one single thing that has kept mankind productivity at its peak    Yes, itâ€™s the automobile industry . Our aim for this project was to make a interactive website for user who can sell/buy Their vehicles. Also we have used our model to create  price prediction feature to our website (it predicts the price of the car based on the attributes given by the user).

## The landing page of our website
> The navbar works to interconnect the webpages of our website.
> The logo of our website acts to  redirect the user to home route.
> The search option redirects to the marketplace of our website.
> Inside the navbar we can redirect user to :- 
>> Price Prediction page </br>
>> About us page </br>
>> Home page </br>

## The prediction system
> The prediction form inputs the information of the user and shows the predicted price of the car by our model on the website. As shown.

## The marketplace place of our website
> The add car button drops down a form to add a car to the market place </br>
> View button drops down a section which shows the information of the car </br>
> Colour code used - </br>
  >> Green:- Sell car </br>

## How we deployed our model using Node JS.
> https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/child-processes/how-to-spawn-a-child-process/ </br>
> This section of code connects Python file with the Node server so that we can predict the cost of the car according to the input given by User.
